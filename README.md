# Fire_Alarm_System
Project build in Embedded C to develop a fire alarm system. Uses specialized hardware like sensors, Bugger, relay system and microcontroller ATMEGA-16.

Detect the smoke from IR Sensor and change in temperature from Temperature sensor. On the basis of the reading fire the bugger and cut off the electric supply from relay system.
